        "{{ModId}}_BerryDelights": "Dear @,^Just last night we were reflecting on our time spent with you, and all the wonderful things that have come from it since you've arrived in the valley. Truth be told, we were all outsiders in our small, little ways; but even though you too were a fish out of water when you arrived in valley, you still took the time to extend a friendly hand out to Sterling as he struggled with moving on. You baked with Mia on quiet nights when it felt like her world was crashing down, and you offered Henry a helping hand to realize he'd been his own worst enemy. ^In many ways, none of us would be the same if you'd never come, and for that, we are all forever grateful for your friendship.^As we thought of you, we decided to write you a recipe for one of our favorite treats. It has a little bit of all of us in it, just as we have a little bit of you in us. We hope that you can enjoy it, and have many better years to come in the valley.^^Sincerely, - Sterling, Henry and Mia.[letterbg Mods\\Himetarts.ARV\\LetterBG 0][#]A Thank You from the Coopers", // no recipe
