  "Pierre.SterlingSwim": "Can you believe I could never convince Abigail to come help his old man at the shop?$2#$b#Who could've known I would've convinced drunkard punk Sterling before my own daughter?$1#$e#... Could you try talking to her? You might convince her.$2",
  "Pierre.SterlingBike": "Tch. What's got that boy looking that happy all of a sudden?",

  "Caroline.SterlingSobriety": "Just yesterday I showed Mia my sunroom and she loved it.#$b#She said it was very professional, can you believe it? Feels important, impressing an agronomist.$1",
  "Caroline.SterlingRelapse": "Oh dear, have you had any news from Sterling? I heard about what happened at the shop from Pierre.#$b#I hope he'll be alright. I know he is troubled, but he was never this bad when he was younger.$2#$e#Pierre was pretty upset after what happened.$2",

  "Haley.SterlingDrugs": "Ewww, why is Sterling being like totally weird? Check up on him, he's acting so shifty and weird.$3#$b#So creepy.$2",
  "Haley.SterlingSobriety": "I do like Sterling's nails. It takes confidence in a man to pain them, you know?",

  "Harvey.SterlingRelapse": "Mia and Henry brought Sterling to see me after what happened.$2#$b#I can't disclose too much, but don't worry. Sterling didn't overdose on anything.#$b#His body was probably just not used to those substances anymore. It didn't like them.$1",
  "Harvey.SterlingDinner": "You had dinner at Mia's? That must be so nice.$4",
