    "SterlingHandwritten":"Hey, @!^^Can you believe I've never written a letter in my life? Much less a handwritten one; I'll admit this is kind of new to me. It's rather romantic, maybe I'll do this more often.^^I wanted to thank you for having my back the other night.^^-Sterling",
    "MiaPinkCake":"Hi, @!^^I've been baking a lot recently, and the boys can't even keep up with all the leftovers anymore. I've sent you the cake I baked this morning, but you should come around the house one of these days so we can have some tea and sweet treats while they're freshly made. Can't wait to see you!^^-Yours truly,^Mia %item object 220 1 221 1 611 1 %%",
    "TJSeeds":"Howdy, @! Fall's comin' and you're probably gonna kick your production into gear before the winter. I'm sendin' some sunflower seeds in case ya might wanna grow 'em this season. Hope they might help ya somehow! Swing 'round if you want some more, I'm sure Mia would love to see ya.^^PS: If you do grow them, it might help to know they're both Haley's and Mia's favorite flowers. Nothing better than puttin' a smile on a lady's face by giftin' em some flowers (or some boys! whatever yer into!)^^-Teddy. %item object 431 10%%"
