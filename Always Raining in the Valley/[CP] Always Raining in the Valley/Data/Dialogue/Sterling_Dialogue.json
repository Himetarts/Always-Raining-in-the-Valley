	"Saloon_Thu6": "Is there a lucky someone in your life, farmer?#$b#There's been a few in my own life, though I'd say lucky is the operating word. I'd guess it's a bad combination of attracting toxic people when you're a bit of a toxic person yourself.#$b#...$2#$b#Sorry, just thinking about my ex. He was a really nice guy, broke up with him before I moved to the valley. It was honestly for the best, the best thing I could do for him that is.",

  	"Saloon_Sat6": "My uncle absolutely sucks, he treats Henry like garbage and then expects him to be his personal slave forever.$5#$b#I really wish Henry learned to *not* act like his slave in the first place, poor guy thinks blood family is all there is to life.#$b#%Sterling grumbles as he downs a good portion of his beer.",
  	"Saloon_Sat8": "What's up, dollface? I'm just having some soda tonight, I know you and my family like me a lot better when I'm sober.",
  	"Saloon_Sun6": "You know, Henry and Mia say like it better when I don't drink.$5#$b#...$12#$b#But after a while you reach a point where you've drank enough and it's not really clear if the real me is the drunk ass and the sober me just a performance.$12",
